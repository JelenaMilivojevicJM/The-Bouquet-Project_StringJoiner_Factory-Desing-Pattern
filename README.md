# The-Bouquet-Project_StringJoiner_Factory-Desing-Pattern

This repository consists of 2 independent projects: 

1) The Bouquet Project: This project represents a program that is an interactive console application. It allows users to create their own virtual bouquet of flowers by choosing between roses🌹, daisies 🌼, or tulips 🌷 , and specifying how many of each they want in their bouquet. The program then prints out a representation of their bouquet, along with some decorative leaves. 🌿  It also counts and displays how many flowers are in their bouquet. The program ends by printing out a bouquet emoji and a message for the user to take their bouquet. 💐 This program showcases the combination of using the StringJoiner class and the Factory Design Pattern. 

2) The Flowers Project: This project represents the program that uses the StringJoiner class to concatenate strings with a comma as the delimiter. This code creates two StringJoiner objects, joinRoses and joinDaisies, each containing different types of flowers. It then merges these two StringJoiners into one, calculates and prints out various statistics such as total number of flowers, total number of delimiters, and total number of delimiters divided by two.

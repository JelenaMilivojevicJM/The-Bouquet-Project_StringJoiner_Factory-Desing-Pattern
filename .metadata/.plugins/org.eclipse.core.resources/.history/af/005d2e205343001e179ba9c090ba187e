/*Explanation: The program is an interactive console application that allows users to create their own virtual bouquet of flowers by choosing between roses, daisies, or tulips, and specifying how many of each they want in their bouquet.
 *  The program then prints out a representation of their bouquet, along with some decorative leaves. 
 *  It also counts and displays how many flowers are in their bouquet. 
 *  The program ends by printing out a bouquet emoji and a message for the user to take their bouquet.
 *  This program showcases the combination of using the StringJoiner class and the Factory Design Pattern.*/
